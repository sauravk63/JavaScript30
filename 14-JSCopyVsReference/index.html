    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3]= 'Jackie';

    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(team, players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = Array.from(players);

    team2[2] = 'Loren';

    console.log(team2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Kang';
    console.log(team3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'George';
    console.log(team4, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const pers1 = person;
    pers1.color = 'Green';
    console.log(pers1, person);


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // const pers2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 44, age : 12});
    
    console.clear();
    pers2.color = 'RED';
    console.log(pers2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const pers3 = {...person};

    pers3.number = 44;

    console.log(pers3);

    const cust = {
        name: 'George',
        age: 32,
        socials:{
            twitter : 'cust@twitter.com',
            facebook : 'web@dev.com'
        }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, cust);
    console.clear();
    console.log(cust);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(cust));
